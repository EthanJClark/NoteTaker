    "Title: The Biology, Behavior, and Ecology of Bunnies (Oryctolagus cuniculus)\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract\n",
    "Bunnies, commonly referred to as rabbits, are small mammals in the family Leporidae, widely known for their soft fur, large ears, and rapid reproduction. Native to Europe and parts of Africa, they have since been introduced globally. This paper explores the biology, behavior, and ecological impact of bunnies, particularly focusing on the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), the most widely studied species.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction\n",
    "Bunnies have played significant roles in ecosystems, agriculture, and even culture. Despite their often domesticated appearance, wild bunnies are resilient, adaptive, and ecologically impactful. Their rapid reproduction, burrowing behavior, and herbivorous diet influence both natural and human-altered environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Biological Characteristics\n",
    "Bunnies are characterized by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Size: Typically 1.2–2.7 kg in adulthood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fur and Coloration: Soft fur; wild types usually gray-brown, while domesticated varieties show a wide range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Teeth: Continuously growing incisors adapted for gnawing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Senses: Excellent hearing and a nearly 360° field of vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "They reproduce prolifically—females (does) can produce 20–40 offspring annually under optimal conditions. Gestation lasts around 28–31 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Behavior and Social Structure\n",
    "Bunnies are crepuscular, most active during dawn and dusk. Wild rabbits live in complex burrow systems called warrens. They communicate through thumps, body posture, and scent marking. Social hierarchies exist, especially among males (bucks), and territorial behavior is common.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ecology and Environmental Role\n",
    "As herbivores, bunnies feed on grasses, herbs, and bark. They contribute to seed dispersal and are a crucial food source for predators such as foxes, hawks, and owls. However, in non-native habitats (e.g., Australia), they have become invasive, leading to massive ecological disruption and agricultural loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Domestication and Human Interaction\n",
    "Domesticated rabbits have been bred for meat, fur, and companionship. Selective breeding has led to over 300 breeds. Despite their docile nature, domestic rabbits require specific care and environmental enrichment to thrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Conservation and Management\n",
    "While rabbits are considered pests in some areas, populations in their native habitats are declining due to disease (e.g., myxomatosis, RHDV), habitat loss, and hunting. Conservation efforts focus on disease control and habitat restoration.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Conclusion\n",
    "Bunnies are more than just cute creatures—they are ecologically significant, behaviorally complex, and biologically unique. Their dual status as pests and endangered species highlights the need for context-specific management and continued study.\n",
